## Data Heterogeneity

- Heterogeneous Risk Minimization (HRM)

    An iterative procedure consisting of two modules. 
    
    The frontend module is heterogeneous environment partition through clustering. The backend module is invariant learning via the environments given by the frontend. The learned features serve as feedback for the frontend module to formulate an iterative procedure. 

- Kernelized Heterogeneous Risk Minimization (KerHRM)

    An extension of HRM using neural tangent kernels (NTK) for application in nonlinear data.
