## Optimization
- Stable Adversarial Learning under Distributional Shifts (SAL)

    Solve the problem of over-pessimism in Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (WDRO) by penalizing different costs for different feature dimensions to create a more realistic perturbed distribution ball. 

- Gradient Norm Aware Minimization Seeks First-Order Flatness and Improves Generalization (GAM)

    Employ first-order flatness information when conducting gradient descent to seek flatter minima and increase the generalization performance.
